# Model Card

See the [example Google model cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports) for inspiration. 

## Model Description

**Input:** The inputs to the model are a set of features based on a persons health etc.

**Output:** The outputs are predictions of whether a person has diabities or not.

**Model Architecture:** I used randomforests for both prediction and feature selection. 

## Performance

Give a summary graph or metrics of how the model performs. Remember to include how you are measuring the performance and what data you analysed it on. 

## Limitations

I would have liked more data, in terms of features and people. Perhaps use a more complex approach such as NNs.

## Trade-offs

Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues.
